# Audio Files

Place your enchanted forest ambient sound files here:

- `enchanted-forest.mp3` - MP3 format for most browsers
- `enchanted-forest.ogg` - OGG format for browser compatibility

The audio will play automatically at low volume (0.2) when the site loads.

Recommended: Use subtle forest sounds like:
- Gentle wind through trees
- Distant bird calls
- Soft rustling leaves
- Light water flowing

Keep the file size reasonable (under 5MB) for faster loading.
